    NirajanBook is an book store with ten retail outlets across Sydney, Sales have been declining of late and a recent customer survey has shown that the lack of an online shopping facility is one of the reasons for the decline.

    In response to this, the company has decided to launch a web site that will allow customers to search for books, view the details of the book they have searched for, check its price and order books. Customers should also be able to open an account for a record of their orders.

    The company has also ascertained that the website will need to allow staff to add, edit, update and delete books, view the customer’s orders.

    In terms of the look of the website, the company would like to utilise a graphical user interface incorporating images to attract customers to the web site. The web site should be as interactive and incorporate a drag and drop function to make the ordering process easy for customers. It should also include a help section where customers can get help for commonly asked questions.
